Welcome to Stoma Comprehensive Automated Neural Network (SCAN). 
Please read the instructions before start. 

 
Data Structure:
    Enable Visualisation: Put Images into a Folder 
    Enable Post-Analysis (Plots & Statistical Table): 
        Main Folder 
                -> Sub Folder1
                -> Sub Folder2 
                -> etc                              
                                                -> Image1
                                                -> Image2 
                                                -> Image3
                                                -> etc

Sub-folder and Image name will display in excel and plots. 

Think about the folder name as the X-axis in plots  
Want to Compare Among Genotype?
Structure the images into Root  -> Genotype1 
                                -> Genotype2 
                                -> etc

Want to Compare same or multiple replicates in differnt time?
Structure the images into Root  -> P1 9:00AM
                                -> P1 5:00PM
                                -> P2 9:00AM
                                -> P2 5:00PM
